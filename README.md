# Simple-Shell

A simple shell supports:

1) Execution of any Linux built-in command (e.g., ls) with basic error handling.

2) Three shell-specific commands: gofolder(cd), log(history), and bye(exit).

3) Basic signal handling: i.e., a user cannot exit the shell simply by typing ctrl-c.

4) Basic command chaining: && and ||.
